        Religion is in every country in some form and that stands true for Quarttet as well. For example, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté around 50% of people believe in Christianity. Three-fifths in Orthodox and the rest in Catholic. Of the remaining 50%, 40% are atheists. That can sound like a lot, but that's only half in comparison to Central Bohemian of the Czech Republic. 80% of all its residents are atheists and around 10% are part of Catholic Christianity. On the other hand, Opole county has the most religious residents in Quarttet. More than 90% are Catholic Christians and only a mere 6% are atheists. That’s a quite big jump. And they are neighboring countries. Crazy right? And last but not least we will look into Rhineland-Palatinate. They don't have a clear favorite but are more balanced. Around 40% of its residents are part of Catholic Christianity, and the rest is almost equally split between Evnangelic protestants and atheists.</p>
